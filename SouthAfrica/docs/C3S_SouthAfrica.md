## C3S Data Rescue in South Africa

Data digitised at the University of Witwatersrand are provided for 10 stations (see the [inventory](https://github.com/C3S-Data-Rescue-Lot1-WP3/Rescued-Data/blob/master/SouthAfrica/docs/C3S_SouthAfrica_inventory.txt)).

#### The Cape of Good Hope Meteorological Registers
Most of the original registers were located in the Cape Town Archives. The registers were inserted amongst incoming and outgoing original colonial letters, archived in bound letter books. It required several weeks of searching through these books and finding the Met Registers. Those found were then photographed with permission from the CT Archives. The registers are for several district centers across the former Cape Colony and include Swartland, Stellenbosch, Tulbagh, George, Uitenhague, Albany, Swellendam, Worcester, and Cape Town between December 1818 and 1826. These instrumental records are the earliest sub-regional multi-station records known to us for Africa. However, there are large gaps – some stations only cover a 2 to 3 months, while others may cover a few of these years. Records for some of the missing months were discovered in the earliest Newspaper in Cape Town, The Cape Town Gazette. Investigations are ongoing to locate possible copies of the registers for missing months. 
The parameters covered are: daily temperature, barometric pressure, descriptions of wind speed and direction. 

#### Meteorological Diary kept at the Port Office of Cape Town (Harbour Master Record)
This record was found in the Cape Town Archives and covers the period 1829-1904. Sadly there are very large gaps in this record. Much time was spent searching for the missing years but it might be that these either no longer exist or are archived somewhere unknown to us. 
The missing periods include: 1834 to 1840, 1851-1854, 1858-1869, 1874-1889, and 1894-1903. The parameters covered are temperature and barometric pressure (3x daily).

#### The Royal Astronomical Observatory record
This forms part of the longest known southern African (and likely southern hemisphere) single station instrumental record, which begins in 1834 and is ongoing to this day. There are a few missing years during the 19th century. The 19th century records have recently been digitized using private funds. The aim has been to continue digitizing this record into the 20th century. While rainfall and temperature records had already been digitized, those for barometric pressure and other parameters had not. We thus photographed records from original register books held at the Royal Astronomical Observatory (now South African Astronomical Observatory – SAAO) for the years 1900-1940. 
The parameters covered are: temperature and barometric pressure (3x daily), daily rainfall, hours of sunshine, cloud cover, wind direction and force.

Time was assumed to be local solar time unless differently noted.
